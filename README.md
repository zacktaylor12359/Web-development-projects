## 6. Pdf Upload
Program that allows the user to upload a pdf and decide the file name. The file is stored in a directory on the server. The name gets stored in a database. The name is the only thing that gets stored in the database. This was the requirement for an assignment, but it's kind of a whack way to do it, because the file name and file path are not actually connect. I may go back in the future and store the path in the database.
